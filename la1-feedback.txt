Hello Ethan Watts!

My records state that you're in a pair.
Your pair partner is mtkhan1@sheffield.ac.uk
(If this is incorrect please get in touch!)

We've reviewed your COM3505 assessment 1 from
https://gitlab.com/ethvnw/com3505-student-2024

Congratulations, you've passed!

As you know, we don't provide marks for this part of the course
assessment, but if we _were_ doing so, we would estimate your work to
be somewhere in the 3rd quartile.

That's reasonable :)

Some feedback:

Your project for the IoT course demonstrates a good understanding of both
network provisioning and implementing over-the-air (OTA) updates using the
ESP32. You've structured your code and documentation to clearly address the
rubric requirements, making your project robust and well-documented.

Your use of LEDs to indicate different stages of WiFi connection and OTA
updates is in line with the assignment's requirements. The touch sensor
implementation as a trigger for OTA updates is a creative approach and
effectively uses the ESP32's capabilities. This not only adheres to the rubric
but enhances the usability and interactivity of your device.

The documentation, including the embedded video link, hardware photos, and
detailed software descriptions, provides a good view of your project, making
it easy to understand and replicate. Your inclusion of testing scenarios in
the documentation shows thoroughness in your testing process, which is crucial
for real-world applications.

The documentation is fairly brief, and might benefit from additional detail
and/or narrative structure.

The touch sensor threshold (`touchRead(T14) > 80000`) is presumably chosen for
consistent responsiveness. It might be helpful to explain your choice of
threshold in the documentation to clarify its purpose and functionality.

Overall, your project meets the rubric's criteria effectively with a
clear demonstration of required skills and thoughtful documentation.
Well done!
